# Drill Press Control

## Project Description
**Drill Press Control** is an embedded systems project designed to interface a stepper motor with a microcontroller (MSP430). The system provides motor actuation, pressure monitoring, real-time clock (RTC) logging, and UART-based user reporting. Signal conditioning and safety features ensure precision and reliability.

## Development

### Part 1: Planning and Design
- Created a flowchart and pinout diagram to define program flow and hardware configuration.  
  ![MSP430 Connections to External Hardware](Part9_Flowchart.pdf)

### Part 2: ADC Sensor Code
- Read simulated pressure data using the MSP430's ADC module.
- Implemented logic to trigger events when pressure thresholds are crossed.  
  ![ADC Sensor Code](FinalProject1.c)

### Part 3: I2C RTC Code
- Communicated with a real-time clock module via I2C.
- Logged timestamps on button presses.

### Part 4: UART Code
- Used UART to display real-time system messages.
- Included sensor data, motor activity, and time information.

### Part 5: LED Timing Code
- Used LEDs to simulate the stepper motor pulses visually.

### Part 6: Full Integration with Stepper Motor
- Combined all previous code modules.
- Added stepper motor control logic and final integration.

### Part 7: Additional Functionality (Final Implementation)

üìÅ **Final Code**: [`FinalProject9main.c`](FinalProject9main.c)

- **ISR Optimization**: Kept interrupt service routines short. Used flags to defer logic to the main loop.
- **Rolling Average for ADC**:
  - Initial method used an O(n) loop, which caused performance issues.
  - Optimized using a circular buffer for O(1) averaging.
- **Pressure Safety Threshold**:
  - 50 lb threshold disables forward motor control.
  - Triggers a buzzer and sends a UART warning.
- **Enhanced ADC Signal Conditioning**:
  - **Zener diode** clipping to cap voltage at 3V.
  - **Difference amplifier** to remove 120 mV offset.
  - **Non-inverting amplifier** (gain = 1.5) to better utilize the ADC range.
